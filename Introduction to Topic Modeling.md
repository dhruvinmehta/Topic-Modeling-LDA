Topic Modeling is a probabilistic method to classify or segregate a given set of text documents into a number of themes or topics. 
This method tries to infer a hidden structure in the set of documents which is similar to the thematic structure of the documents. 
LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is used for this purpose.
