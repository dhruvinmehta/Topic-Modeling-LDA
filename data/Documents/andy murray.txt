He is the second man in the open era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, after Stefan Edberg lost his third final in 1993. In 2011, Murray became only the seventh player in the Open Era to reach the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments in one year.[13] During the 2013 season he became the sixth man in tennis history to have won over $30 million in career prize money.

Personal life

Murray was born to Judith (Erskine) and William Murray in Glasgow, Scotland.[2] His maternal grandfather, Roy Erskine, was a professional footballer in the late 1950s.[15] Murray's brother, Jamie, is also a professional tennis player, playing on the doubles circuit. Murray was born with a bipartite patella, where the kneecap remains as two separate bones instead of fusing together in early childhood,[16] but wasn't diagnosed until the age of 16. He is seen frequently to hold his knee due to the pain caused by the condition and has pulled out of events because of it.[17] Murray began playing tennis at the age of three when his mother Judy took him to play on the local courts.[18] He played in his first competitive tournament at age five and by the time he was eight he was competing with adults in the Central District Tennis League.[19]

Murray attended Dunblane Primary School, and was present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre,[20] when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom.[21] Murray says he was too young to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography "Hitting Back" he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car.[22] Murray later attended Dunblane High School.[23][24]

Murray's parents split up when he was only 10.[25] He believes the impact this had on him could be the reason behind his competitive spirit.[26] At 15, he was asked to train with Rangers Football Club at their School of Excellence, but declined, opting to focus on his tennis career instead.[27] He then decided to move to Barcelona, Spain. There he studied at the Schiller International School and trained on the clay courts of the Sánchez-Casal Academy. Murray described this time as "a big sacrifice".[24] His parents had to find £40,000 to pay for his 18 month stay there.[25] While in Spain, he trained with Emilio Sánchez, formerly the world No. 1 doubles player.[24]

Murray has been in a relationship with Kim Sears, daughter of player-turned-coach Nigel Sears, since 2006.[28] Their engagement was confirmed by Murray's agent on 27 November 2014.[29] Sears is a pet portraitist and a former pupil of Burgess Hill School.[30]

In February 2013, Murray bought Cromlix House for £1.8 million which opened as a 15-room five-star hotel in April 2014.[31] Later that month Murray was awarded Freedom of Stirling and became a Doctor of the University of Stirling in recognition of his services to tennis.[32]
Career
Junior tennis

Leon Smith, Murray's tennis coach from 11 to 17,[33] described Murray as "unbelievably competitive", while Murray attributes his abilities to the motivation gained from losing to his older brother Jamie.

In July 2003, Murray started out on the Challenger and Futures circuit. In his first tournament, he reached the quarterfinals of the Manchester challenger.

After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets.[172] His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.

At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets.[173] At the Miami Masters, Murray made it through his first four matches without dropping a set, and after overcoming Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, faced David Ferrer in the final. After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which neither Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two.[174] Murray briefly fell back to number 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the number 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open. Later, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.[175] On 15 May 2013 at the Rome Masters, Murray retired due to a hip injury during his second round match against Marcel Granollers on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to be fit for the start of the French Open.[176]

Speaking at a press conference after the match, Murray said, "As it is, I'd be very surprised if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan for the next few days then make a decision on Paris after the next five days."[177] He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury.[178] After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomas Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Cilic of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Cilic in three sets to claim his third title at Queen's Club.

Going into Wimbledon, Murray hadn't lost a match on grass since the previous year's final, and was on a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker and Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets to set up a clash with Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.
Murray holds the Wimbledon trophy following his victory in the 2013 men's final.

Despite the Serb being the favourite to win the title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, to become the first British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahoney in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches.[179] With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.

At the US Open, Murray entered a Grand Slam tournament as defending champion for the first time, and started strongly with a straight sets win against Michael Llodra. He backed this up with wins over Leonardo Mayer, Florian Mayer and Denis Istomin to reach the quarterfinals at a major for the 11th straight tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in straight sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals.[180] Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the Great Britain Davis Cup team in their World Group Play-off tie on clay against Croatia, where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16 year old Borna Coric in straight sets, Murray teamed up with Colin Fleming to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavic in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the World Group by defeating Dodig in straight sets.

Following the Davis Cup, Murray's season was cut short by his decision to undergo surgery, in order to sort out the lower back problems that had caused him problems since the early stages of the previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term.[181] Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.[182]
2014: Recovery from surgery, inconsistencies & late return to form
Main article: 2014 Andy Murray tennis season

Murray started his season at the Qatar Open in Doha. In the first round, he defeated Mousa Shanan Zayed in straight sets in 37 minutes without dropping a single game, but was defeated in three sets by world number 40 Florian Mayer in the second round, despite being a set and a break up three games into the second set.[183] He then played a warm-up match at the 2014 AAMI Classic in Kooyong against world No. 43 Lleyton Hewitt, losing in two close tiebreaks. Murray next headed to Melbourne for the 2014 Australian Open, where he drew world number 112 Go Soeda of Japan. Despite worries that he was not match-fit, Murray got off to a strong start, dispatching the Japanese number 2 in under 90 minutes, losing just 5 games in the process. He next went on to defeat Vincent Millot and Feliciano Lopez respectively in straight sets. In the fourth round, Murray dropped his first set of the tournament on his way to beating Stephane Robert in four sets to set up a meeting with long-standing rival Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. Despite saving two match points to take the third set, he ultimately went out in four, ending his streak of four consecutive Australian Open semifinals.[184] As a result of losing before the final, Murray fell to number 6 in the world, falling out of the top 5 for the first time since 2008.

He next headed to the United States to compete in the Davis Cup first round with Great Britain, who went into the tie as outsiders. Murray won both of his ties against Donald Young and Sam Querrey respectively, helping Britain to their first Davis Cup quarterfinal since 1986.[185] Murray's next tournament was the Rotterdam Open after receiving a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Cilic in straight sets in the quarterfinals. His following competition, the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in Acapulco, ended in a semifinal defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three sets that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets. At Indian Wells, Murray struggled in his first two matches against Lukáš Rosol and Jirí Veselý respectively, overcoming both in close three-set encounters to set up a fourth round clash with Canadian Milos Raonic, which he lost in three sets. In March, Murray split with coach Ivan Lendl, who had been widely praised for helping Murray achieve his goal of winning Grand Slam titles.[186] At the 2014 Miami Masters, Murray defeated Matthew Ebden, Feliciano Lopez and Jo Wilfried Tsonga but lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. In the Davis Cup quarterfinals against Italy, he beat Andreas Seppi in his first rubber, then teamed up with Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber, but in his final singles match, was stunned by Fabio Fognini in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber. However, in this match his compatriot, James Ward was defeated by Andreas Seppi, also in straight sets, knocking Murray and Great Britain out of the Davis Cup.

Murray next competed at the Madrid Open and following his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player Elena Baltacha.[187][188] He then lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the following round. Murray then reached the quarter-finals of the Rome Masters where he lost to world number one Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had been up a break in the final set.[189] At the French Open, Murray defeated Andrey Golubev and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12-10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7-5 in a deciding set.[190] He followed this up with a win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gael Monfils in the quarter-final, which saw Murray rise to world No. 5 and equal his best ever French Open by reaching the semi-finals. However, he subsequently lost to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.[191] After losing the 2014 French Open semi-finals to Rafael Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world number one, and two-times slam titlist, Amelie Mauresmo as his coach[192] in a 'historic move'; the move makes Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.[193]

After strong grass court seasons in 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who are seeded first and second respectively.[194] He began his title defence with straight sets wins over David Goffin[195] and Blaž Rola, defeating the latter for the loss of just two games.[196] Murray continued his good form, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut[197] and Kevin Anderson,[198] the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinal. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak at Wimbledon with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2008.[199] After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to 10th in the world, his lowest ranking since 2008.[200]

Prior to the North American hard court swing, Murray announced he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo until the end of the US Open, but was ideally looking for a long-term deal.[201] He also revealed he had only just returned to a full training schedule following his back surgery last September.[202] Murray reached back-to-back quarter-finals at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters, losing to eventual champions Jo Wilfried Tsonga,[203] after being a break up in the decider,[204] and Roger Federer, after being two breaks up in the second set, respectively.[205] He then made it to the quarterfinals of the 2014 US Open, losing to Novak Djokovic, after earning his first top ten win of the year in the previous round against Jo Wilfried Tsonga.[206] This was the first season since 2009 where Murray failed to reach a grand slam final. As a consequence Murray fell outside of the top 10 ranking places for the first time since June 2008.[207]

Murray took a wildcard into the inaugural Shenzhen Open in China, entering as the number 2 seed. Victories over Somdev Devvarman, Lukáš Lacko and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon. In the final he faced Tommy Robredo of Spain, the second final between the two. After saving five championship points in the second set tie break, Murray went on to win the title in three sets, Robredo's drop in fitness ultimately proving decisive.[208] He then took his good form into Beijing, where he reached the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets,[209] however he lost in the third round at the Shanghai Masters to David Ferrer despite being a set up.[210] Following his early exit in Shanghai, Murray took a wildcard into the Vienna Open in an attempt to claim a place at the ATP World Tour Finals. He reached the final, where he once again faced Ferrer, and triumphed in three sets for his second title of the season, and the 30th of his career.[211] Murray defeated Ferrer again in the semi-finals of the Valencia Open to move into his third final in five weeks, and further strengthen his bid for a place at the season finale in London.[212] In a repeat of the Shenzhen Open final, Murray again saved five championship points as he overcame Tommy Robredo in three sets.[213] Murray then went on to reach the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters, where he was eliminated by Djokovic in what was his 23rd match in the space of only 37 days.[214] However, his win over Dimitrov in the third round had already guaranteed him a spot at the ATP World Tour Finals.[215]

At the ATP World Tour Finals, Murray lost his opening round robin match to Kei Nishikori[216] but won his second match against Milos Raonic.[217] However, he lost his final group match against Federer in straight sets and only managed to win one game against him, marking his worst defeat since losing to Djokovic in the 2007 Miami Masters, eliminating him from the tournament.[218] Despite the loss, his late-season run had already propelled him back up the rankings to number 6 in the world, his best ranking since June.

Following the conclusion of the season, Murray mutually agreed a split with long-term backroom staff, training partner Dani Vallverdu and fitness coach Jez Green. They had been with him for five and seven years respectively but were both reported to have been unhappy at the lack of consultation they had been given about the appointment of Mauresmo.[219] Murray also took part in the inaugural season of the International Premier Tennis League, representing the Manila Mavericks, who had drafted him as an icon player in February.[220] Murray took part in the first three matches of the tournament which were all played in Manila.[221]
Rivalries

Murray vs. Djokovic
Main article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry

Djokovic and Andy Murray have met 23 times with Djokovic leading 15–8.[222][223] Djokovic leads 2–0 on clay, 13–6 on hard courts, and Murray leads 2–0 on grass. The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being only a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray won the first match they ever played as teenagers. The pair have met 9 times in finals, with Murray leading the series 5–4. Five of the finals were at ATP Masters 1000 events, with Murray winning the first three in straight sets, but Djokovic defeated Murray in the most recent 2 finals: first in straight sets in Miami, second in three sets at the Shanghai Masters. They have met in four Major Finals: The 2011 Australian Open, the 2012 US Open, the 2013 Australian Open and the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. Djokovic has won in Australia twice, and Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon. The former of Murray's victories was the longest ever final at the US Open, tying with the 1988 final played between Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander at 4 hours and 53 minutes, whilst the latter was notable for being the first home triumph in men's singles at Wimbledon since 1936.

They also played a nearly five-hour long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 7–5 in the fifth set after Murray led 2 sets to 1. Murray and Djokovic met again in 2012 at the London 2012 Olympic Games, with Murray winning in straight sets. Djokovic has won five of their six most recent meetings, including the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five match point opportunities in the second set, however Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set. He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. The three set matches they played in Rome and Shanghai in 2011 and 2012 respectively were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year for each respective season.[224][225] Many see this as the emerging rivalry, as the two are both in their prime years, and are both likely to be playing for at least another 5 years.[226][227] Their most recent meeting was in the quarter-final of the 2014 Paris Masters, where Djokovic defeated Murray in straight sets.
Murray vs. Federer
Main article: Federer–Murray rivalry

Murray and Roger Federer have met 23 times with Federer leading 12–11. Federer leads 11–10 on hard courts, they are tied at 1–1 on grass and they have never met on clay. Federer won the first professional match they played, however after 2006, Murray led their rivalry with Federer failing to regain the lead until their recent meeting at the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals.[228][229]Federer leads 5–3 in finals, having won each of their Grand Slam Final meetings at the 2008 US Open[89] and 2010 Australian Open, both of which Federer won in straight sets, and the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, where Murray took the first set, but ended up losing in 4 sets. Murray leads 6–2 in ATP 1000 tournaments and 2–0 in finals. They have met four times at the ATP World Tour Finals, with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008[230] and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009, 2010 and in 2012. In August 2012, Murray met Federer in the final of the London 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon Centre Court, just four weeks after the 2012 Wimbledon Final in which Federer had defeated Murray to win his 7th title at the All-England Club. Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a Career Golden Slam. In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a Major in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down.[231] Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer, the other two being Nadal and Djokovic. Their most recent meeting took place at the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals in London with Federer winning the match in straight sets.[229]
Murray vs. Nadal
Main article: Murray–Nadal rivalry

Murray has played against Rafael Nadal on 20 occasions since 2007, with Nadal leading 15–5. Nadal leads 6–0 on clay, 3–0 on grass and 6–5 on hard courts. The pair regularly meet at Grand Slam level, with nine out of their twenty meetings coming in slams, with Nadal leading 7–2 (3–0 at Wimbledon, 2–0 at the French Open, 1–1 at the Australian Open and 1–1 at the US Open).[232] Eight of these nine appearances have been at Quarter-final and Semi-final level. They have never met in a Slam final, however, Murray leads 2–1 in ATP finals, with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009[233] and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year[234] and Tokyo[235] in 2011. Murray lost three consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals to Nadal in 2011 from the French Open to the US Open. Of the past 19 Grand Slam drawsheets, they have been drawn in the same half 16 times. The pair had not met for three years since the final of the 2011 Japan Open until the quarter finals of the 2014 Rome Masters, although they were scheduled to meet in the semi-final of the 2012 Miami Masters before Nadal withdrew with injury.[236] The most recent meeting between the two was at the semifinal stage of the 2014 French Open, with Nadal triumphing in a dominant straight sets win for the loss of just 6 games.
Playing style
At the Boodles Challenge, Stoke Park, June 2012

Professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today."[237] His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of Miloslav Mecír. Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution.[238] Tim Henman has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game, succeeding Lleyton Hewitt.[239]

Murray's tactics usually involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally. Murray is also one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.[240] Murray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points.[241][242] Murray is most proficient on a fast surface,[243] like grass, where he has won 5 Singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the Olympic Gold Medal. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game.[244]
Endorsements and equipment

In 2009 German manufacturer Adidas and Murray signed a five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes.[245] The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen, Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring. Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel.[246] At the end of their contract together Addidas decided not to re-sign with Murray,[247] and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company Under Armour in December 2014.[248] Murray uses Head rackets, and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand.[249]

In June 2012, the Swiss watch manufacturer Rado announced that Murray had signed a deal to wear their D-Star 200 model.[250]
Charitable work

Murray is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with David Beckham. Footage from the launch at Wembley Stadium can be seen on YouTube and the charity's website. Murray also made 'Nets Needed', a short public service announcement, for the charity to help raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against malaria.[251] Murray has also taken part in several charity tennis events, including the Rally for Relief events that took place prior to the start of the 2011 Australian Open.[252]

In June 2013, Murray teamed up with former British number 1 Tim Henman for a charity doubles match against Murray's coach and eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl, and world No. 6 Tomáš Berdych at the Queen's Club in London. The event named Rally Against Cancer was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.[253][254] The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the AEGON Championships, on Sunday 16 June. Subsequently, following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money pot to The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.[255]

In June 2014, following the death of Elena Baltacha, Murray featured in an event known as 'Rally for Bally.' Murray played at Queen's Club alongside Victoria Azarenka, Martina Hingis, Heather Watson and his brother Jamie. The event raised money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis. Children from Baltacha's academy took to the court play alongside Murray.[256][257]
Image
National identity

Murray identifies himself as Scottish and British.[258] His national identity has often been commented on by the media[259] and the subject of jokes by the British public.[260] Whilst making a cameo appearance on comedy show Outnumbered, Murray is asked whether he is British or Scottish, to which he responds "It depends if I'm winning".[261] Much of the discussion about Murray's national identity began prior to Wimbledon 2006, when he was quoted as saying he would "support anyone but England" at the 2006 World Cup. English ex-tennis player Tim Henman confirmed that the remarks had been made in jest and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman.[262]

Murray initially refused to endorse either side of the debate in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, citing the abuse he had received after his comments in 2006.[263] Just before the referendum, Murray tweeted what was considered by the media an endorsement of the yes vote.[a][264][265][266] He received some abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as "vile" by Police Scotland; one referred to the Dunblane massacre.[266] A few days after the vote, in which a 55% majority opposed Scottish independence, Murray said that he did not regret stating his view, but admitted that it was out of character and that he would concentrate on his tennis career in future.[266]
Other

In 2006, there was uproar after a match with Kenneth Carlsen. Having been given a warning for racket abuse, he went on in the post-match interview to state that he and Carlsen had "played like women" during the first set.[267] Murray was booed for the remark, but explained later that the comment had been intended as a jocular response to what Svetlana Kuznetsova had said at the Hopman Cup.[268] A few months later, Murray was fined for swearing at the umpire during a Davis Cup doubles rubber with Serbia and Montenegro Davis Cup team. Murray refused to shake hands with the umpire at the end of the match.[269]

In 2007, Murray suggested that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that everyone knows it goes on,[270] in the wake of the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko.[271] Both Davydenko and Rafael Nadal questioned his comments, but Murray responded that his words had been taken out of context.[272]
