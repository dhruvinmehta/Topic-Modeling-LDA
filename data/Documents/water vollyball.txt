Water volleyball also called Pool volleyball is a game played by many around the world. It is played in countries with a temperate or tropical climate and sometimes cold climates. Water volleyball is both an individual and team sport. It can be played between two teams, each team consisting of 1 to 4 players, depending on the area of water in which the game is being played, however the teams must be equal.
History

- The sport was created in November 2008, with the Federazione Internazionale di Volley Acqua (International Federation of Water Volleyball) created on January 1, 2009. Elections are held every year for a new president. Because the Federation was only recently created, there are currently 2 co-presidents who can authorize rule changes as long as the other co-president agrees. As of January 7 there will be a sole President, Alex P. The sport was created for swimmers, water polo players, and other persons interested in aqua sports. The inaugural competitive match was held on the January 6th 2009, but with many other matches for fun played since the 1960s.

Laws of the game

- The court

- - The court must be a rectangle a minimum 3 meters in length to a maximum of 6 meters in length. It can be a minimum of 2 meters in width to a maximum of 5 meters in width. The net must run across the width of the court and be centered along the length so that both players have an equal amount of court in which to play. In most pools there is a deep end and a shallow end. If possible try putting the net where both players are in the deep end.

- - Serving

- - The server must hit the ball upwards, towards the receiver and it must be within arms length of the receiver when standing still. The serve is not allowed to be a spike and the receiver can not spike of the serve. One team serves for 2 points then the other team serves, and play continues in this fashion. When it is 10 apiece, you start serving 1 serve each. A flip of a coin at the start of the game is used to see who serves first, or else the person in the deep end serves first.

- - The ball

- - Any ball can be used as long as it is spherical and both players agree on which ball will be used before the start of the match. Most players agree that the best ball to play with is a beach ball approximately 28 to 40 centimeters in diameter, and well inflated. It has been found that the smaller the ball the harder it is to play. But it has been played with semi-pumped up Football (soccer) balls. Both result in very even matches.

- - Game play

- - Water volleyball is both an individual and team sport. It can be played between two teams, each team consisting of 1 to 4 players, depending on the area of water in which the game is being played, however the teams must be equal.

One team is chosen to serve first, whereupon they serve twice, then the team which did not serve first serves twice, and play continues in this fashion. The aim is to score eleven points before your opponent or opponents. However, if the score gets to 10 apiece, then the team to score either two points ahead of the other team, or else first to fifteen points, wins the game, There are usually 5 games in a match,at the start of the match the players or teams flip a coin to see who goes on which side.

In the summer of 2013, water volleyball as a sport became famous in Lahore, Pakistan when a group of boys brought it to wider audience under the auspices of Punjab Swimming Association President Mr. Shaan Lashari. The games were played in a best of five manner with a maximum of 6 players on either side. The points were scored on a rolling basis, i.e. on every serve a point is scored. The side that wins the point makes the next serve. The first team to get to 20 points was the winner of the set, however the winning margin must at least be 2 points (e.g. 21-19). The net was placed at 8 ft height and sides were swapped after the score reached a total of 10 points. In the first Open Championship of 2013, Mr. Noor Khan won the award for the Most Successful Smasher.

In most pools there is a deep end and a shallow end. If possible try putting the net where both players are in the deep end. But if that is not possible then play each game as normal, but change sides after each game, so each player gets 2 games on the shallow side and 2 games on the deep side. If a 5th game is required then swap sides when the scores reach 10 points for example 5-5,2-8,4-6 and so on.

Scoring

The first team to reach 11 points wins. If the score reaches 10 apiece, then it is first team to by 2 points or first to 15 points.

Misconduct

If a players purposely tries to harm another player by hitting, kicking etc., the player will resign the match and a ban may be imposed by the presidents. Bans can last between 1 match to a life ban. However, this ban can be repealed by the presidents, or else a fine can be paid to the Federation.
Strategy

Most players play with power, attempting to hit it as fast as possible so the opposing player doesn't have time to react. Others try to hit it in the side to try get it out of reach of the player.
