The ICC T20 Championship is an international Twenty20 cricket competition run by the International Cricket Council. The competition is notional in that it is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule.[1] After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided by the total number of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating.[2]

As of 5 January 2015, Sri Lanka lead the ICC T20I Championship with a rating of 131.

Qualification

According to the ICC website, "Only teams who have completed at least eight T20 international matches since 1st August between three and four years ago will have their rating above converted into a ranking on the main table." [3]
Points

The calculations for the Table are performed as follows:

    Each team scores points based on the results of their matches.
    Each team's rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations).
    A match only counts if played in the last three years.
    Matches played in the first year of the three-year limit count one-third; matches played in the second year count two-thirds; matches played in the last year count fully; essentially, recent matches are given higher weighting.
    To determine a team's rating after a particular match:
        Determine the match result (win, loss, or tie)
        Calculate the match points scored:
            If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is fewer than 40 points, then:
                The winner scores 50 points more than the opponent's rating
                The loser scores 50 points fewer than the opponent's rating
                Each team in a tie scores the opponent's rating
            If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is more than or equal to 40 points, then :
                The winner, if it is the stronger team, scores 10 points more than its own rating
                The winner, if it is the weaker team, scores 90 points more than its own rating
                The loser, if it is the stronger team, scores 90 points fewer than its own rating
                The loser, if it is the weaker team, scores 10 points fewer than its own rating
                The stronger team in a tie scores 40 points fewer than its own rating
                The weaker team in a tie scores 40 points more than its own rating
        Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the table) and determine the new rating. However, matches (and the points) which do not lie in last three year range will have to be removed.

    Points earned by teams depend on the opponents ratings, therefore this system needed to assign base ratings to teams when it started.
