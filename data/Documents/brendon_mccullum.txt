In 2003 he played in a Test series against England and scored what was then his highest score, an innings of 96 at Lord's. His maiden Test century came several months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh. He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when dismissed one short of his hundred. His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe.

He was selected in the 20-man ICC World XI squad for the ICC Super Series in July 2005.

On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 not out as New Zealand went on to be the first team to whitewash Australia in a 3 match ODI series since 1997. He struck a massive six off the first ball of the last over against Nathan Bracken to level the scores, before he finished it off with a boundary. In his matchwinning innings he partnered Craig McMillan to a world record equalling 6th wicket partnership of 165.[8]

On 21 March 2007, he set a new World Cup record, by smashing 50 runs from just 20 balls against Canada in St Lucia. He finished his innings with 52 runs from 21 balls, including 1 four and 5 sixes, with a strike rate of 247.61. The previous record had been set by Mark Boucher (South Africa) against The Netherlands on 16 March (50 runs from 21 balls).

On 18 April 2008, he claimed the record for highest individual score in a Twenty20 innings, scoring 158* from only 73 balls, which included 13 sixes and 10 fours in boundaries, for the Kolkata Knight Riders against Bangalore Royal Challengers in the first game of the Indian Premier League helping them get a much deserved 140 run victory.[9] This eclipsed the previous record mark of 141, held by Australian Cameron White, McCullum faced an over White bowled in that match and smashed him for 24, it was White's only over in that match.[10] In the same match he also claimed the record for most sixes (13) in a Twenty20 innings,[11] the most sixes in an individual Twenty20 innings has since been surpassed(16) by Englishman Graham Napier. This record was eventually broken by Chris Gayle when he piled on 175 runs in IPL 2013.He was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala in 2011 IPL auctions.He returned to KKR in 2012.In the 2014 IPL auctions,He was bought by Chennai Super Kings.He was given the role of opening the innings along with West Indian Dwayne Smith and the pair was considered as the most dangerous opening pair in the league's history.

On 1 July 2008, he scored his maiden ODI century, eventually getting dismissed for 166 against Ireland. He shared in a 266 run opening stand with James Marshall, which is the highest ODI partnership for any wicket in Black Caps history and the second highest opening partnership in all ODIs.

On 5 April 2009, on day three of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand, he displayed an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid. Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight into the hands of a waiting Brendon McCullum.[12] A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had been a little slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so.[13]

On 6 November 2009, vs Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century (131, 129 balls, 14 4's, 3 6's) to elevate New Zealand to 303 and win the match to level the series.[14]

On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh, he scored 185, the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket. He was also involved in the record highest sixth-wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 runs with Martin Guptill, missing out on the world record by just 12 runs.

On 27 February 2010, becomes just the second player to score a T20I hundred, finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle's record of 117.

On 4 May 2010 McCullum became the first player to score 1000 T20 international runs. He achieved this feat playing against Zimbabwe in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 at Guyana On 28 June 2010, Brendon McCullum said he will not keep wicket for New Zealand in Test matches. He, however informed that he will still keep in 50-overs & T20 over games.[15] This meant that McCullum would have to cement his place in the test team as a batsman. He did a fine job in his first innings since handing over the Wicket-keeping duties he scored 65 runs and was engaged in a 104 run partnership with Ross Taylor he was promoted to the position of opener in tests rather than his usual number 5 position. McCullum did however have experience of opening the innings because he opens for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket.[16]

On 21 September 2012 at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh at Pallekele, setting a new record for the highest Twenty20 International innings, and becoming the first player to score two Twenty20 International centuries. This record was broken by Aaron Finch on the 29th of August against England, when he scored 156. However McCullum still remains the only player to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries.[5]

Between 16 and 18 February 2014 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, McCullum scored 302 runs in the third innings of the second test against India, becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-century. He shared a 352 run partnership with BJ Watling, a record sixth wicket stand,[17] rescuing New Zealand from a likely inning defeat. McCullum closed the innings at 680/8d, both the highest ever innings by New Zealand, and the highest ever third innings in Test cricket history.[17][18]

On 21 November 2014, McCullum recorded his first ever wicket at test level, a caught-and-bowled against Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed during their second test.

On 29 November 2014, McCullum scored a century on day 2 of the third test against the same opposition, in which both teams decided to call off play on the day before as a tribute to Phillip Hughes, and hand-written P.H. under each player's squad number as a further mark of respect. He was bowled out on 202 after scoring ten sixes in his innings, by far a record for New Zealand opening batsman.[19] Two years removed from his debuts as NZ captain, in which the team was bowled out for a poultry 45, Black Caps returned to respectability.

On 13 December 2014, McCullum was named New Zealander of the Year by New Zealand Herald due to his continued co-operation with ICC over the match-fixing scandal which resulted in Chris Cairns being charged for lying to court, and also changing the perception of the Black Caps as easy-beats.[20][21]

On the first day of the Boxing Day Test at Hagley Park, McCullum scored 195 in the first innings against Sri Lanka, and giving him 1000 test runs in a calendar year (1164 at the end of the match, with Kane William at 929), and the fastest test century (in 74 balls), beating his own record against Pakistan in Sharjah,[22] but he fell 5 runs shy of his 4th 200+ scores in a calendar year. His 33 sixes in test cricket in a single calendar year is also a world record.[22] It is also worth noting that New Zealand only played 9 test matches in 2014.[22] He also helped to push New Zealand to score 429/7 after day one, the most runs New Zealand has ever scored in a single day of play in test cricket.[22] It ended with an 8-wicket win, which makes it 5 test wins out of 9 in 2014, the most wins in a calendar year. He also closed the year with a triple century and two double centuries, the third person to do so (Donald Bradman and Michael Clarke).

On 3 January 2015, McCullum returned to Basin Reserve, where he scored his triple century against Sri Lanka. While he got a 2-ball duck on a green pitch and three errors as a fielder, he was given a key to Wellington, a symbolic equivalent of "Honourary Citizen", joining Wellington-born Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor for their works on Lord of The Rings as the third person to receive such a gift for last year's heroics.[23] However, the ground witness a double century that test by Kumar Sangakkara, a fellow former wicketkeeper-batsman.
Role

McCullum originally played in the side as a wicketkeeper-batsman. His glovework improved during his tenure as the New Zealand wicketkeeper. His batting is good enough to earn him selection for the Black Caps alone, shown by the occasions on which he has been unable to keep but has still been selected as a batsman.[24] He opens the batting for New Zealand in ODIs with steadily improving success. He is an aggressive batsman who is particularly strong over extra cover, often lofting the ball into the stands. In 2010 McCullum hung up the gloves In Test cricket due to continued body strain and became a specialist batsmen in Test cricket, opening the innings in his first match as a specialist batsmen against India in Ahmedabad. He was described as a player "especially suited to Twenty20 cricket" when he signed for a five-week stint at Glamorgan in June 2006.[25] The stint included the entire domestic 2006 Twenty20 Cup. He was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders of the IPL for $700,000. His contract with the IPL is for three years.

He has the ability to play the Dilscoop, which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's head. Playing this shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin's head and can also execute reverse sweep well.[citation needed]

During the Twenty20 World Championship in 2009, the wicketkeeping duties was given to Peter McGlashan. He was seen practicing his medium bowling.

McCullum had to decide whether to play for New South Wales, KKR, or Otago in the 1st edition of the Champions League. Since KKR did not qualify, he had only to consider playing for either New South Wales or Otago; eventually he had decided to play for Otago alongside brother Nathan McCullum.[26]

In 2012, BJ Watling became McCullum's replacement as wicketkeeper in Tests, but due to Luke Ronchi's struggles in ODI's, McCullum still remained as wicketkeeper in ODIs and T20s. But by late 2013, McCullum's recurring back problems meant he can no longer perform wicketkeeping duties effectively, he gave up his gloves to Ronchi in ODIs and T20s, and McCullum became a middle order batsman, or as a cover for opening the batting in tests, having batted at 1,2,5-7 in his career, while his fielding position becomes predominantly mid-off or mid-wicket.[27] He is also a very seldomly-used part-time medium pace bowler in tests. He got his first wicket in all forms of international cricket from a caught-and-bowled against Sarfraz Ahmed of Pakistan which ended their first innings in 2014.[28]
Personal life

McCullum is married to Ellissa McCullum (née Arthur), an Australian from Caniaba, New South Wales.[29] They have a son Riley and a daughter Maya.[30]
