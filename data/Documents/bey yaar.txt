Plot

The film begins with Uday, an artist, narrating a story of two friends Tapan aka Tanio and Chintan aka Chako. In order to make a quick buck, they loose some money to a con who poses as the blessed Goddess. Chintan's father runs a tea stall, in which hangs a painting of a prominent artist M. F. Hussain. The painting was gifted to his father by the painter as a sign of friendship between them. Tapan and Chintan ask Uday to copy the painting and decide to mortgage the original to an art dealer. After several nights, Uday successfully copies the painting, they place the duplicate in place of the original. They mortgage the original painting with the art dealer, Y. B. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi). The next day Gandhi calls Chintan informing that the painting is a fake. Chintan immediately meets him. Gandhi informs him that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer and that its a fake, implying that Tapan had double crossed him or that his father must have been lying and in actuality it must have been sold a long time back. Chintan angrily confronts both and out of anger his father throws him out of the house. Later Chintan reconciles with other friends and understands that Gandhi has cheated them. Gandhi publicly humiliates Chintan's father and announces in media that the painting and the story of the friendship behind it are fake. The friends then hatch an elaborate plan to get back the painting and pride of Chintan's father.
